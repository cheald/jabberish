Jabberish

Jabberish is a DRb-driven Jabber server designed for use in multi-server Rails apps.
Just drop in the plugin, configure, start the server, and off you go.

Jabberish fails silently if the jabberish DRb process isn't running, so it won't bring your app crashing down around your shoulders.

1) edit config/jabberish.yml with your desired settings
2) rake jabberish:start
3) Invoke Jabberish from your code.

  JabberishAgent.deliver("cheald@gmail.com", message_to_deliver)

For example, to send yourself IMs when your app has an error, in application.rb:

  def rescue_action(e)
	# The third parameter is "throttle", which will cause Jabberish to refuse to send the same message to a given recipient twice in a row
    msg = sprintf("[#%s] %s (%s)", Time.now.to_i, e, e.backtrace.first)
    JabberishAgent.deliver("cheald@gmail.com", msg, true)
  end
  
Enjoy!
